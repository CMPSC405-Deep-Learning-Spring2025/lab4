# Lab 4 Report

## 1. CNN Architectures and Implementation

- TODO: Explain the **two** core CNN architectures (e.g., ResNet-18 and DenseNet-121) you implemented and why you chose them.
- TODO: Describe modifications (if any) you made to the pre-trained models.
- TODO: State whether you used **CPU or GPU** and justify your choice.

## 2. Experiment Setup
- TODO: **Dataset Used**: Name, number of classes, preprocessing steps.
- TODO: **Model Selection**: Justify your selection of the **two CNN architectures**.
- TODO: **Experiment Variations**: Describe the two experiment variations you chose to implement.
- TODO: **Hyperparameters**: Learning rate, batch size, optimizer, number of epochs.

## 3. Training and Validation Process
- TODO: Number of training epochs and total training time for **each model**.
- TODO: Loss and accuracy trends over epochs (include plots if possible) for **each model**.
- TODO: Validation accuracy achieved for **each model**.
- TODO: Any challenges faced during training (e.g., overfitting, convergence issues) for **each model**.

## 4. Experiment Results and Model Comparisons
TODO: Show experimental results, including any or all of the following but not restricted to these:
- **Accuracy Comparison**: Table showing accuracy for **each model** and experiment variation.
- **Loss Trends**: Graphs comparing loss curves for **each model**.
- **Feature Map Analysis**: Include feature map visualizations and discuss your observations, **comparing the feature maps between the two models**.

## 6. References
- Cite any papers, articles, or code resources used, including any LLM help (include your prompts in this case).
